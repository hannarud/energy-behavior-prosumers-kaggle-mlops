# Energy Behavior of Prosumers prediction - an MLOps project

Solving ["Enefit - Predict Energy Behavior of Prosumers"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-energy-behavior-of-prosumers) Kaggle competition while extensively using different MLOps techniques. Project created as a part of [MLOps Zoomcamp 2025](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp) course.

## Problem Definition

Energy prosumers are individuals, businesses, or organizations that both consume and produce energy. This concept represents a shift from the traditional model where consumers simply purchase energy from utilities and rely on centralized power generation sources. Energy prosumers are actively involved in the energy ecosystem by generating their own electricity, typically through renewable energy sources like solar panels (or wind turbines, small-scale hydropower etc.). They also consume energy from the grid when their own generation is insufficient to meet their needs.

* The number of prosumers is rapidly increasing, associated with higher energy imbalance - increased operational costs, potential grid instability, and inefficient use of energy resources
* The goal of the project is to create an energy prediction model of prosumers to reduce energy imbalance costs. If solved, it would reduce the imbalance costs, improve the reliability of the grid, and make the integration of prosumers into the energy system more efficient and sustainable Moreover, it could potentially incentivize more consumers to become prosumers and thus promote renewable energy production and use
